# Release documentation

To release a new version of the formula and automatically bottle, use the following steps:

1. Open a PR with the changes and wait for the tests to pass
1. Once the tests pass, add the `pr-pull` tag to the PR. This will trigger the release and close the PR (it will push the commits for you)
